# RPi Control With EspruinoPuck 

This Github repository contains: 
1) Code to upload to the Espruino Puck.js (bought on Adafruit.com at: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3372). Upload it using the Espruino Web IDE interface.
2) Code to upload to the Raspberry Pi to control the LED light using the bluetooth Puck.js Espruino bluetooth button. I used a Raspberry Pi 4B for this project. 

The cod for the Raspberry Pi (RPi) includes comments on the top on how to properly wire your LED light to the Raspberry Pi. 

Good luck!
